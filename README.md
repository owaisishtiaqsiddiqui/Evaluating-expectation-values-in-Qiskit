To calculate the expectation value of the operator M as defined in your equation, you can follow these steps:

1. Prepare the quantum state |Ψ⟩. For this example, let's assume |Ψ⟩ is a Bell state.
2. Construct the operators P+ and P-. In Qiskit, you can create these as PauliSumOp.
3. Use the StateFn class to represent the state and the operators.
4. Use the CircuitSampler and MatrixExpectation classes to calculate the expectation values.
5. Add the expectation values of P+ and P- to get the expectation value of M.



$$\langle\Psi| M |\Psi\rangle = \sum_{j}\Psi_{j}{} \langle m_{j} | M | ( \sum_{i} \Psi_{i} |m_{i} \rangle )$$

which is equal to 
$$\langle\Psi| M |\Psi\rangle = \sum_{i,j} \Psi_{j}^{*} * \Psi_{i} * m_{i} \langle m_{j} | m_{i} \rangle $$

$$\langle\Psi| M |\Psi\rangle = \sum_{i} |\Psi_{i}|^{2} m_[i] $$ 

where 

$$\langle\Psi| M |\Psi\rangle = \sum_{i} P_{i} m_{i} $$

$$\langle M \rangle = (+1)P_{+} - (-1)P_{-} = P_{+} + P_{-} $$

The above equations we ve written describe the process of calculating the expectation value of an operator M in quantum mechanics. In the context of quantum computing, this process is often done by preparing a quantum state |Ψ⟩, applying the operator M, and then measuring the resulting state.

In your case, M is defined as M = P+ - P-, where P+ and P- are projectors onto the +1 and -1 eigenstates of M, respectively. The expectation value of M is then given by ⟨M⟩ = ⟨Ψ|M|Ψ⟩ = P+ - P-
